<h1>Slider</h1>

Slider turns your Android device into a MIDI controller that will work with any MIDI compatible app on OS X.<br />
Please note that this is an early release and that it can be buggy.<br/> 
I strongly recommend not to use it for live performances for the moment, but it should do the trick for home production.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<li>Have at least one IAC bus actived (Audio/MIDI Setup > Window > Show MIDI Window > IAC Driver)</li>
<li>Have already paired your Android and OS X devices together before doing anything (will be fixed in a next release)</li>
<li>The OS X device must be the first device in your Android's bluetooth paired devices list (will be fixed in a next release)</li>

<h2>How to use it</h2>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Compile both Android and OS X applications<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Launch the OS X application first (OS X app is the server one, so it has to broadcast the service first)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Launch the Android app and hit "connect"<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Enjoy<br/>
