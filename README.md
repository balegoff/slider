<h1>Slider</h1>

Slider turns your Android device into a MIDI controller that will work with any MIDI compatible app on OS X.<br />
Please note that this is an early release and that it can be buggy.<br/> 
I strongly recommend not to use it for live performances for the moment, but it should do the trick for home production.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

*Have at least one IAC bus actived (Audio/MIDI Setup > Window > Show MIDI Window > IAC Driver)
*Have already paired your Android and OS X devices together before doing anything (will be fixed in a next release)
*The OS X device must be the first device in your Android's bluetooth paired devices list (will be fixed in a next release)

<h2>How to use it</h2>

1. Compile both Android and OS X applications
2. Launch the OS X application first (OS X app is the server one, so it has to broadcast the service first)
3. Launch the Android app and hit "connect"
4. Enjoy
